# 1T_DRAM
1T DRAM, or one-transistor dynamic random-access memory, is a type of DRAM cell that stores data in a capacitive region controlled by a transistor without the use of a separate capacitor. Instead, it uses the parasitic body capacitance of silicon on insulator (SOI) transistors. 

Here are some characteristics of 1T DRAM:
Density: 1T DRAM cells have a high density.
Integration: 1T DRAM cells are easily integrated with high-performance logic circuits because they are constructed using the same SOI process technologies.
Access times: 1T DRAM has better access times than capacitor-based DRAMs, but slightly worse than SRAM.
Reads: Reads in 1T DRAM are non-destructive.
Refreshing: Cells still need to be refreshed.
